# TripPriceCalc

This is a simple web app that calculates how much a road trip will cost based on your car's MPG, the distance you're traveling, and the current gas price in your area.

## What It Does

- You enter:
  - Distance of your trip in miles
  - Your vehicle's miles per gallon (MPG)
  - The current price of gas per gallon
- It calculates:
  - Total gallons of gas you'll need
  - Total cost of the trip

## How It Works

- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Uses basic form inputs to get user data
- Calculates the total cost using the formula:
  - `(Distance / MPG) * Gas Price`
- Displays the result instantly on the page

## Why I Made It

I wanted a quick and easy way to estimate how much a road trip would cost without having to do the math myself every time. This tool helps me budget for trips more accurately.

## Stuff You Can Tweak

- You can modify the styling in `style.css` to match your preferences
- The calculation logic is in `script.js` if you want to add more features
- Could be expanded to include:
  - Round-trip calculations
  - Different fuel types
  - Multiple stops with varying distances
