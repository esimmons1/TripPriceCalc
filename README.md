What this is:  
This is a simple web app that calculates how much a road trip will cost based on your car's MPG, the distance you're traveling, and the current gas price in your area.

---

What it does:  
- You enter:  
  - Distance of your trip in miles  
  - Your vehicle's miles per gallon (MPG)  
  - The current price of gas per gallon  
- It calculates:  
  - Total gallons of gas you'll need  
  - Total cost of the trip

How it works:  
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Uses basic form inputs to get user data  
- Calculates the total cost using the formula:  
  `(Distance / MPG) * Gas Price`  
- Displays the result instantly on the page

---

Why I made it:  
I wanted a quick and easy way to estimate how much a road trip would cost without having to do the math myself every time. This tool helps me budget for trips more accurately.

Stuff you can mess with:  
- Modify styling in `style.css` to match your preferences  
- The calculation logic is in `script.js` if you want to add more features  
- Could be expanded to include:  
  - Round-trip calculations  
  - Different fuel types  
  - Multiple stops with varying distances

As per usual, if you're going to steal or use it at least credit me please. Thank you for reading and have a nice day.
